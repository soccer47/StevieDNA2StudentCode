| Oct 9  | 12:35pm-1:05pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I decided to start by using HashMaps to find the number of occurrences of a String. I add every string as its own key with the number of time's its appeared, then if its already there, add one to the number of appearances. I'm currently over counting because i'm counting overlapping strings, which I'm trying to figure out how to fix. |
| Oct 9  |  1:05pm-1:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I have continued to think about ways to solve the overcounting error I'm getting with my HashMap approach. I'm considering changing to a non-HashMap approach because of this error, but we'll see. |
| Oct 9  |   4:30pm-5pm    |                                                                                                                                         I went for a walk and tried to think of ways to debug my code and also new ways to approach the problem. I thought of a couple things I could change in my HashMap code, but none of them solved my overcounting error. I also heard Beckett say in class that his solution was "simple", which made me try to think of ways to solve the problem with only a while or for loop. I thought of using a while loop with indexOf and substring, which I will now try implementing. |
| Oct 9  |  5:25pm-5:55pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                        The while loop with indexOf and substring didn't work. I'm now trying to think of new ways to approach the problem. I also just realized that I was counting for the number of occurrences of the STR in the sequence, not the longest chain. I have decided to instead go back to my hashmap approach and tweak it to find the indexes of each occurrence, then find how many times the word is repeated after. |
| Oct 9  |   6pm-6:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am continuing to struggle to figure out an effective approach to the problem, as I haven't been able to get a working method yet. Using a HashMap might work, however I also feel like there's an easier/simpler way. I will continue to try to think of new approaches to try. |
| Oct 9  |  8:10pm-8:40pm  |                                                                                   I am basically going in circles at this point, as I can't figure out how to make a method that finds the indexes of all of the occurrences of the word without taking an insane amount of time. I reverted my code back to the hashmap approach (which only counts the number of times the word appears) because that way I at least have code that runs relatively quickly, and finds something related to the goal. To solve this problem with hashmaps I would need to make the keys hold the index of each occurrence of the STR. |
| Oct 11 |  11am-11:30am   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I am working on a method to look through the int of converted chars to ints and find matches. I am having trouble thinking through this logically, and I think I might want to use something with hashmaps. I don't know if this would be more efficient, however it is easier for me to conceptualize. |
| Oct 11 |  11:30am-12pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I decided to try going back to a HashMap based approach. I am still pretty confused, and need to figure out a way to store indexes of each string efficiently. If I could figure that out, I could easily find the length of the longest STR. I think I might just make my own object instead of a map to fix this. |
| Oct 11 |   8pm-8:30pm    | I have started an approach where I make my own object to store the indexes where each combo of letters appears. I'm using an array of ArrayLists of ints to do this, and so far have been working on implementing this approach in my code, just trying to complete a first draft. I'm running into a bit of confusion on how to convert my binary of the sequence (A = 00, C = 01, G = 10, T = 01) back to a base 10 number, but I think I'll use a String to hold the binary sequence and use parseInt from there. I'm using this binary approach in order to have a unique value for each possible combo of letters. |
| Oct 11 |   8:30pm-9pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I'm almost done implementing a first draft of the approach I mentioned above. I have just been creating my first draft, and haven't ran my code yet. I worked out the confusion I was having with the binary conversion. |
| Oct 11 |   9pm-9:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I got my code to run and work for the two smallest test cases, which I'm pretty happy with given the amount of time it took me to get here. I initially was having various bugs when I was adding in and checking the indexes fo each occurrence of the STR, however after a bit of debugging I was able to get my code to run and work. My code still is super slow for the other cases. |
| Oct 15 |  5:25pm-5:55pm  |                                                                                                                                          I started implementing the hashing approach in my code. I also spent 10-15 minutes thinking through how I would traverse through the integers in my code, and have decided to convert the letters to integers in the same for loop that I compare the possible STR to the actual STR integer. I also realized that to take out the first int, in the number, all I have to do is mod by the radix to the power of the string length, which I hadn't fully comprehended before. |
| Oct 15 |  7:15pm-7:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I have continued to implement my hashing approach, and have finished my first draft. I am currently not passing the tests, as my numerical sequence of characters becomes negative relatively quickly, and I'm not sure why. However, I know the few lines of code that must be giving me this error, and I actually feel pretty good about the rest of my code. |
| Oct 15 |  7:45pm-8:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I have continued to try to debug my code. I am still not passing any of the tests (and my code still isn't identifying any of the matches), however I am no longer having the issue of my potential STR sequence being negative. I know the error is in the line of code where I cut off the first letter of the sequence, I just have to fix that. |
| Oct 15 |  8:25pm-8:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I realized that I'm not accounting for the fact that the starting indexes of the STRs are spaced apart by the length of the STR. I will have to account for that in order to solve the problem (obviously). |
| Oct 16 |  3:10pm-3:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I have created a method that finds all of the indexes of the STR successfully. However, I still haven't been able to write code that finds the longest repeated streak of the STRs correctly. This is the only thing I have left |
| Oct 16 |  3:40pm-4:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I have continued to try to write a method that successfully finds the longest sequence of repeated indexes of the STR. I know that my if statement that checks if the indexes of the STR are consecutive if functional. However, I still haven't been able to use this to correctly find the length of the repeated STR chain. |
| Oct 16 |  4:10pm-4:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I'm still trying to make code that finds the longest repeated chain given a list of indexes and the ability to check whether they're consecutive or not. I don't know why this is so hard, however I also feel like I will ge the answer soon because I have everything except for this one piece. I might try using a tree? |
| Oct 16 |  7:05pm-7:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I tried using a HashMap instead of an ArrayList to keep track of the indexes where the STR appears. I still am not able to get the longest chain of STRs. I don't really know what to do at this point. |
| Oct 18 | 10:50am-11:20pm |                                                                                               I realized that my code that found the indexes where the STR appeared actually had an error, which I fixed my making the radix one greater than the number of characters in the sequence (before, an A would have the same value as a T if it was one place earlier). I now accurately get the locations of all the STRs. However, my code that finds the longest String is still very very slow, which means I will probably consider a different approach for this area of my code. I'm not sure what this will be yet. |

I think that the portion where I skip a section of the characters is slightly faulty. I also notice that my code is now missing some of the indexes where the STR appears. |

So far I am still having the error where I fail to identify certain indexes of the STR. I am now trying to use a substring to skip the next few characters in the sequence, however this is still faulty. |

I realized that one of my substring calls was going one index too far. I quickly added them and they actually worked, and now my code works. |
