| Oct 9  | 12:35pm-1:05pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I decided to start by using HashMaps to find the number of occurrences of a String. I add every string as its own key with the number of time's its appeared, then if its already there, add one to the number of appearances. I'm currently overcounting because i'm counting overlapping strings, which I'm trying to figure out how to fix. |

I'm considering changing to a non-HashMap approach because of this error, but we'll see. |
| Oct 9  |   4:30pm-5pm   |                                                                                                                                         I went for a walk and tried to think of ways to debug my code and also new ways to approach the problem. I thought of a couple things I could change in my HashMap code, but none of them solved my overcounting error. I also heard Beckett say in class that his solution was "simple", which made me try to think of ways to solve the problem with only a while or for loop. I thought of using a while loop with indexOf and substring, which I will now try implementing. |
| Oct 9  | 5:25pm-5:55pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                        The while loop with indexOf and substring didn't work. I'm now trying to think of new ways to approach the problem. I also just realized that I was counting for the number of occurrences of the STR in the sequence, not the longest chain. I have decided to instead go back to my hashmap approach and tweak it to find the indexes of each occurrence, then find how many times the word is repeated after. |
| Oct 9  |   6pm-6:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am continuing to struggle to figure out an effective approach to the problem, as I haven't been able to get a working method yet. Using a HashMap might work, however I also feel like there's an easier/simpler way. I will continue to try to think of new approaches to try. |
| Oct 9  | 8:10pm-8:40pm  |                                                                                   I am basically going in circles at this point, as I can't figure out how to make a method that finds the indexes of all of the occurrences of the word without taking an insane amount of time. I reverted my code back to the hashmap approach (which only counts the number of times the word appears) because that way I at least have code that runs relatively quickly, and finds something related to the goal. To solve this problem with hashmaps I would need to make the keys hold the index of each occurrence of the STR. |

I am having trouble thinking through this logically, and I think I might want to use something with hashmaps. I don't know if this would be more efficient, however it is easier for me to conceptualize. |
| Oct 11 |  11:30am-12pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I decided to try going back to a HashMap based approach. I am still pretty confused, and need to figure out a way to store indexes of each string efficiently. If I could figure that out, I could easily find the length of the longest STR. I think I might just make my own object instead of a map to fix this. |
| Oct 11 |   8pm-8:30pm   | I have started an approach where I make my own object to store the indexes where each combo of letters appears. I'm using an array of ArrayLists of ints to do this, and so far have been working on implementing this approach in my code, just trying to complete a first draft. I'm running into a bit of confusion on how to convert my binary of the sequence (A = 00, C = 01, G = 10, T = 01) back to a base 10 number, but I think I'll use a String to hold the binary sequence and use parseInt from there. I'm using this binary approach in order to have a unique value for each possible combo of letters. |

I have just been creating my first draft, and haven't ran my code yet. I worked out the confusion I was having with the binary conversion. |
| Oct 11 |   9pm-9:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I got my code to run and work for the two smallest test cases, which I'm pretty happy with given the amount of time it took me to get here. I initially was having various bugs when I was adding in and checking the indexes fo each occurrence of the STR, however after a bit of debugging I was able to get my code to run and work. My code still is super slow for the other cases. |
